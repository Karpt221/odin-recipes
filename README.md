I know html basics pretty well, that's why for me this project was primary an opportunity to enhance my skills in using git and github.

During making this project I practiced:

- writing a proper git commit messages

- usage of basic git commands (push, commit, add, clone, status, log).
Also I learnd to use rebase command for editing old commits messages
